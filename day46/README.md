   - A Spotify Developer account is required for authentication and interacting with the API.

2. **Scraping Billboard Data**  
   - The app scrapes data from **Billboard Hot 100** chart using [**BeautifulSoup**](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).  
   - Scrapes the data for a specific date from:  
   `https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/{date}`

3. **Creating Playlist**  
   - A playlist with the name **Billboard Hot 100 ‚Äì {date}** is created on the authenticated Spotify account.

4. **Adding Songs to Playlist**  
   - The app checks each track in the Hot 100 chart and adds it to the playlist if it‚Äôs available on Spotify.  
   - Unavailable songs are skipped.
